## Synopsis

Word is written in CoffeeScript, but you can use it in your non-coffee app.

```coffeescript

word = require 'word'

result = null

result = word.stripSlashes "O\\'reilly" # strips slashes.

result = word.stripQuotes "foo ' bar" # strips quotes

result = word.quotesEntities "foo ' bar" # quotes to entities

result = word.random 5 # returns random string with length of 5

result = word.repeat 'foo', 3 # repeats n times a string

result = word.censor 'foo', 'foo', '***' # censors bad words.

result = word.censor 'foo bar baz', ['foo', 'bar'], '***'

result = word.stripLinks 'baz <a href="http://example.com" class="foobar">Foo</a>' # strips links

result = word.autoLink "http://example.com/" # links -> a + href

result = word.excerpt 'foobar', 3 # extracts an excerpt from string

result = word.limit 'foo bar baz bar foo.', 3 # limits text to n words.

result = word.wrap 'foooo bar baz', 3 # wraps text to given length.

result = word.pluralize 2, 'dog' # pluralize or not, depends on supplied count.

```

Want to use it as helper in your express app? Sure.

```javascript

var express = require('express');
var word = require('word');
var app = express.createServer();

app.helpers({ word: word });

```
